Document for Java vs Python




What is Java?
Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric, programming language. It is among the most used programming language. It also used as a computing platform, and it was first released by Sun Microsystem in 1995. It was later acquired by Oracle Corporation.

What is Python?
Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language. It has built-in data structures, combined with dynamic binding and typing, which makes it an ideal choice for rapid application development. Python also offers support for modules and packages, which allows system modularity and code reuse.


It is one of the fastest programming languages as it requires very few lines of code. Its emphasis is on readability and simplicity, which make it a great choice for beginners.


KEY DIFFERENCES
Java is a compiled+ interpreted Language whereas Python is an Interpreted Language
Java is statically typed whereas Python is dynamically typed
Java has a complex learning curve whereas Python is easy to learn and use
Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric, programming language whereas Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language.
Java takes 10 lines of code to read from a file while Python only needs 2 lines of code.
Java language uses curly braces to define the beginning and end of each function and class definition, whereas Python uses indentation to separate code into separate blocks.
In Java, multiple inheritances is partially done through interfaces, whereas Python supports both single and multiple inheritances.
Java offers limited string related functions, whereas Python offers lots of string related functions.
Java program can run on any computer or mobile device which is able to run the Java virtual machine (JVM) while Python programs need an interpreter installed on the target machine to translate Python code. Compared to Java, Python is less portable.
Java is best for Desktop GUI apps, Embed Systems, Web application services, whereas Python is excellent for scientific and numeric computing, Machine learning apps,more.
Java offers stable connectivity, while Python offers weak connectivity.


Why Java?

Here, are benefits/ pros of using Java

Detailed documentation is available.
A large pool of skilled developers available
A huge array of 3rd party libraries
It allows you to form standard programs and reusable code.
It is a multi-threaded environment that allows you to perform many tasks at the same time in a program.
Excellent performance
Easy to navigate libraries
Why need Python?
Very simple syntax compared to Java, C and C++ languages.
Used for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the general overarching AI field. Very useful in data analysis and visualization.
Extensive library and handy tools for developers
Python is cross-compatible
Python has its auto-installed shell
Compared with the code of other languages, python code is easy to write and debug. Therefore, its source code is relatively easy to maintain.
Python is a portable language so that it can run on a wide variety of Operating systems and platforms.
Python comes with many prebuilt libraries, which makes your development task easy.
Python helps you to make complex programming simpler. As it internally deals with memory addresses, garbage collection.
Python provides an interactive shell that helps you to test the things before it's actual implementation.
Python offers database interfaces to all major commercial DBMS system.
Supports imperative and functional programming
Python is famous for its use in IoT.
History of Java
Here, are important landmarks for Java language

The Java language was initially called OAK. Originally, it was developed for handling portable devices and set-top boxes. Oak was a massive failure.
In 1995, Sun changed the name to "Java" and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning www (World Wide Web) development business.
Later, in 2009, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and took ownership of three key Sun software assets: Java, MySQL, and Solaris.
History of Python
Here, are important landmarks for Python language

Python was first conceived in the late 1980s, but its implementation started only in December 1989
It was invented in the Netherlands, by Guido van Rossum.
Rossum published the first version of Python (0.9.0) in February 1999
It was derived from ABC programming language, which is a general-purpose programming language.
Nowadays, Python is maintained by a core development team although Rossum still plays a vital role in directing its progress
